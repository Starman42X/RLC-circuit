# RLC-circuit
This is an interactive Python file using Tkinter, OS, Matplotlib, Numpy and Pandas to use for the RLC circuit lab report at HSO.
It outputs the resonance frequencies as well as the lower & upper cutoff frequencies with the resulting bandwith, the calculated resistance, inductance and capacities.
Everything will be plotted using matplotlib. To compare the measurements to the theoretical values, everything will be plotted for measuremtent and theoretical values.

## What you need:

### Two .csv files containing your measurements formated like the following:
f / Hz	I / mA	phi / °	UR / V	ULC / V

### Your component specifications:
Your Voltage [V], your resistance [Ω], your inductance [H], your capacities [μF]


please use RLC complex current.py as the RLC Datenauswertung.py is an older non complete version
